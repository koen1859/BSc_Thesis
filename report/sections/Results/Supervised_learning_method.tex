\subsection{Supervised learning method}
The supervised learning model results in an $R^2$ of 0.95, Mean Absolute Error of 943 meters, and Mean Absolute Percentage error of about 6.4\%, for the test
sample. This is a strong improvement on the BHH formula when restricting $\beta$ to be equal across areas. This method also outperforms the BHH formula
when considering the estimated true values for $\beta$ for each neighborhood. 
When the correct value for $\beta$ is unknown, this model yields far superior estimates compared to the BHH formula. However, when the true value for 
$\beta$ is known, the difference in prediction errors becomes small.
